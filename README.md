## 👋 Welcome!

### I love building, especially in TS, React, Vue, Node.js, Express.js, SQL (PostgreSQL), and NoSQL (MongoDB). 🏗️

- 👷 In my most recent work, I've built and maintained scalable applications for clients in various industries, including healthcare, consumer goods, and Edtech. Some of them include an AI-powered Helpdesk, a project management tool, a mobile telehealth app, an RBAC Admin Dashboard, and a public site with 200k+ active users
- 💻 Before that, I designed components and improved the CI/CD pipeline at for an edtech company's internal tools and public site (React app with 200k+ unique annual visitors).
- 🔐 Before that, I built ShieldQL, an open-source JavaScript library that secures GraphQL endpoints within RESTful Express APIs through user authorization, authentication, and query sanitization.
- 🕴️ I also gave talks on AWS, React Error Boundaries, and Design Patterns in Typescript.
- Before all of that, I was a chief of staff at a consumer goods company, a management consultant at EY-Parthenon, 🕴️ and a Golden Bear at UC Berkeley 🐻
