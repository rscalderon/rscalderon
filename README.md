ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! I'm a Typescript specialist who loves building scalable full-stack applications.

I specialize primarily in React, Node.js, Docker, Next.js, Express.js, SQL (PostgreSQL), and NoSQL (MongoDB).

Iâ€™m currently building internal tools (including a CRM and a project management tool) for a consumer goods company. Before that, I designed components and improved the CI/CD pipeline at CS Engineering - for their internal tools and public site (React app with 200k+ unique annual visitors). Before that, I built ShieldQL, an open-source JavaScript library that secures GraphQL endpoints within RESTful Express APIs through user authorization, authentication, and query sanitization. I also gave talks on AWS, React Error Boundaries, and Design Patterns in Typescript.
