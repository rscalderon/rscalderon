## 👋 Welcome!

### 🏗️ I'm engineer who loves building scalable full-stack apps 🚀 

### I specialize in Typescript, React, Node.js, Docker, Next.js, Express.js, SQL (PostgreSQL), and NoSQL (MongoDB).

- 👷 I’m currently building internal tools (including a CRM and a project management tool) for a consumer goods company.
- 💻 Before that, I designed components and improved the CI/CD pipeline at for an edtech company's internal tools and public site (React app with 200k+ unique annual visitors).
- 🔐 Before that, I built ShieldQL, an open-source JavaScript library that secures GraphQL endpoints within RESTful Express APIs through user authorization, authentication, and query sanitization.
- 🕴️ I also gave talks on AWS, React Error Boundaries, and Design Patterns in Typescript.
- Before all of that, I was a management consultant at EY-Parthenon 🕴️ and a Golden Bear at UC Berkeley 🐻
